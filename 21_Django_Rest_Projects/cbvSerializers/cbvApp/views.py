Django Rest Framework (DRF) Generics:
Mixins helps us reduce the number of lines of code we need to write to create endpoints. But we still have to
repeat handler methods and action methods across the ReSTful APIs we create. This is where DRF Generics help us.
They give us a set of classes we can use which help further reduce number of lines of code we need to write.
They give us classes we can use for it like:
- CreateAPIView
- ListAPIView
- RetrieveAPIView
- DestroyAPIView
- UpdateAPIView

They give us combination classes as well to support all the non-id and id-based operations, like:
- ListCreateAPIView
- RetrieveUpdateAPIView
- RetrieveDestroyAPIView
- RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView

You can extend any of above classes based on what youâ€™re intending to do!
For example, below two classes on your view can support list all, create, retrieve specific object,
update and delete the students!! So, say, we just need to List Students and not Create them, we will
import generics.ListAPIView and not generics.ListCreateAPIView. Similarly, if we do not need delete
functionality, on StudentDetail class, we will import generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView and not the
generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView !!

# Since we're using mixins (above), we no longer need to write so much code for various models. For example, we provide
# serializer once for non-primary-key or primary_key based operations (classes) and DRF (Django Rest Framework) can
# reuse the serializer for variaous methods in the class, like get, post, etc. Also, we do not need to manually
# save the data, DRF does it for us, all we need to do is invoke the action methods that come with mixins classes we
# inherit the two classes from, like ListModelMixin, RetrieveModelMixin, etc.!
